## Image Specifications

All images should be:
- PNG format for icons and logos
- JPG format acceptable for photos/screenshots
- Optimized for web (compressed to reduce file size)
- High-quality but under 500KB per image

## Fallback

The HTML includes fallback emoji displays when images are not found, so the site will still look good while you gather the proper images.

## Recommended Image Sources

- **Icons**: flaticon.com, iconmonstr.com, or heroicons.com
- **Dashboard Mockups**: Use Figma or Sketch to create mockups
- **Stock Photos**: unsplash.com or pexels.com
- **Logo**: Create with Canva, Adobe Illustrator, or hire a designer

## Quick Start

You can start by using emoji/unicode characters as placeholders (already implemented in the HTML), then replace with actual PNG files as they become available.
